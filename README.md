This is the final product of HW4. I'm sorry I am not able to do what I initially would like to. 

As you can see, the code in this repo was largely the TA's demonstration code for this project. I tweaked the code a bit so that instead of showing the attributes for all the pokemons, I was only going to show the attributes for the fire type pokemons. My attributes are also limited to just the health and the attack data. I changed the x axis and the y axis of the scatter plot to the strength and the number instead of the relative strength and the relative number, also changing the color of the dots to make each pokemon differentiable. Again, the code is largely NOT written by myself. I refered to the TAs code as learning purpose and tweaked it.
