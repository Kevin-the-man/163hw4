This is the final product of HW4. I'm sorry I am not able to do what I initially would like to. 

As you can see, the code in this repo was largely the TA's demonstration code for this project. I tweaked the code a bit so that instead of showing the attributes for all the pokemons, I was only going to show the attributes for the fire type pokemons. My attributes are also limited to just the health and the attack data. I changed the x axis and the y axis of the scatter plot to the strength and the number instead of the relative strength and the relative number, also changing the color of the dots to make each pokemon differentiable. Again, the code is largely NOT written by myself. I refered to the TAs code as learning purpose and tweaked it.

UPDATE for project 1:

This is my final submission project for project 1. I was not able to create 3 linked visualizations that are totally dependent of each other. I was able to build on top of my homework 4 project and create one other visualization that is a duplicate of the second visualization with slightly more information. If you look into the code, you can then see my attempts in creating a selection for the bar chats in the second visualization. My initial plan was to provide a comparison of the health and the attack data of the selected pokemon to the strongest and the weakest. I was close to achieving but the deadline came by. I would like to keep working on it and getting better. 

All in all these projects have brought the best out of me. I have no experience in web dev and was able to build such visualizations. Definitely appreciate the help and encouragement of the professor and the TA.
